Feature: Fees calculations

  Background:
    Given the fees configuration named "fees-config-1":
      | maker fee | infrastructure fee |
      | 0.5       | 0.6                |
    And the price monitoring named "price-monitoring":
      | horizon | probability | auction extension |
      | 60      | 0.99        | 2                 |
    And the simple risk model named "simple-risk-model-1":
      | long | short | max move up | min move down | probability of trading |
      | 0.2  | 0.1   | 100         | -100          | 0.1                    |

    And the following network parameters are set:
      | name                                    | value |
      | network.markPriceUpdateMaximumFrequency | 0s    |

      | market.fee.factors.treasuryFee          | 0.002 |

    And the markets:
      | id        | quote name | asset | risk model          | margin calculator         | auction duration | fees          | price monitoring | data source config     | linear slippage factor | quadratic slippage factor | sla params      |

  Scenario: 001: Testing fees get collected when amended order trades (0029-FEES-005)
    Given the parties deposit on asset's general account the following amount:
      | party   | asset | amount |

      | trader5 | USD   | 5000   |
      | trader6 | USD   | 5000   |

    When the parties submit the following liquidity provision:
      | id      | party   | market id | commitment amount | fee   | lp type    |
      | lp1     | aux1    | ETH/DEC21 | 10000             | 0.002 | submission |
      | lp1     | aux1    | ETH/DEC21 | 10000             | 0.002 | submission |
      | trader2 | trader2 | ETH/DEC21 | 100               | 0.002 | submission |
    When the network moves ahead "2" blocks

    And the parties place the following orders:
      | party | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     |
